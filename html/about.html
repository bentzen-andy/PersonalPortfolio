    <p>Hi there! My name is Andy. I love pizza, hate black olives, and I've recently discovered 
        joy of solving problems with code. <br>

        A few years ago, I started working as an intern with a CAD team at an office furniture 
        manufacturer. I started out with some basic file creation, and quality-checking tasks. 
        I noticed early on that there was a repetitive rhythm to the work, and I started thinking, 
        "Wow, I wonder if I could teach the computer how to do some of these things for me." <br>

        Before I knew it, I was off and running on some learning online tutorials learning things
        really weird scripting language to automate some of the CAD work.
