    <p>Hi there! My name is Andy. I love pizza, hate black olives, and I've recently discovered 
        joy of solving problems with code. <br><br>

        A few years ago, I started working as an intern with a CAD team at an office furniture 
        manufacturer. I started out with some basic file creation, and quality-checking tasks. 
        I noticed early on that there was a repetitive rhythm to the work, and so I started thinking, 
        "Wow, I wonder if I could teach the computer how to do some of these things for me." <br><br>

        Before I knew it, I was off and running on some online tutorials--learning this 
        really weird scripting language to automate some of our CAD work.Since then I've taken a few 
        classes and read a few books, and I feel like I lean something each and every day.  <br><br>
        
        Feel free to browse thorough my digital portfolio to check out what I've been working on lately.
